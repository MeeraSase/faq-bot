# Advanced Features

This project includes several unique and advanced features that make it stand out from a basic FAQ bot.

---

## ✅ Multilingual Support

- Ask questions in **English, Hindi, or Marathi**.  
- The chatbot automatically translates your question to English, finds the best match, then translates the answer back to your language.

---

## ✅ Voice Input Support

- Users can speak their questions instead of typing (if implemented).  
- Makes the chatbot more accessible and user-friendly.

---

## ✅ Auto-Learning Unknown Questions

- Questions not recognized by the FAQ are **saved to `unknown_questions.txt`**.  
- Allows you to review and expand the FAQ database over time.

---

## ✅ NLP-based Question Matching

- Uses **SentenceTransformers** to compute semantic similarity.  
- Even if the question wording is slightly different, the chatbot can understand and provide the correct answer.

---

## ✅ Professional UI

- Modern, clean chat container interface.  
- Includes project title, small tagline, and footer for a polished look.

---

## ✅ Flask Backend

- Python **Flask framework** handles API requests for the chatbot.  
- Easy to extend with additional features in the future.
